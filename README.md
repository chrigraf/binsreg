# BINSREG

The `binsreg` package provides Stata and R implementations of binscatter methods, including partition selection, point estimation, pointwise and uniform inference methods, and graphical procedures.

This work was supported in part by the National Science Foundation through grants [SES-1947805](https://www.nsf.gov/awardsearch/showAward?AWD_ID=1947805) and [SES-2019432](https://www.nsf.gov/awardsearch/showAward?AWD_ID=2019432).

## Major Upgrades coming in Fall 2020:

- L2 and other metrics for hypothesis testing.

- New command/function binsreglincom for testing of linear combinations across subgroups (e.g., H0: mu1(x)=mu2(x) for all x). For now, see option by() for joint plotting of marginal confidence bands.

- New command/function binsxtreg for panel data estimation, inference and binned scatter plots. For now, in Stata use the command i. or ib(). for incorporating fixed effects (as with the regress command).

- Handling of formulas in R package.

- Recentering of binscatter estimate of \mu(x) to account for additional covariates. For now, the package sets additional covariates at zero.

- Backwards compatibility with Stata 13. For now, Stata 14 or better is needed.

## Stata Implementation
